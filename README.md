# X-Plane_Warthog
## Warthog HOTAS T.A.R.G.E.T Profile


### My Profile for X-Plane 10/11

Due to DirectX contraints of only being able to have 32 buttons I've had to set some items as keypresses
but tried to use the X-Plane defaults e.g. Flaps up and Down

# HOW TO USE

Download the source code and open the X-Plane11.tmc file in the TARGET Script Editor 
and click run, Minimize the TARGET window and then load X-Plane, configure your switches and buttons 
and then Enjoy
